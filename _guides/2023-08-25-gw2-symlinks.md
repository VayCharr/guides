Using a Directory Junction, you can re-use the files you already have from your standalone GW2 installation on Steam. This works because the Steam version is a 1:1 copy of the standalone version (aside from some Steam-specific configuration files).

[mklink â€” Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/mklink)

# Setting up a directory junction

## Select installation location

Determine where you want your Guild Wars 2 Steam installation to be located. The folder structure typically looks like this:

```text
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common
```

Make sure there is no existing Guild Wars 2 folder within your Steam directory. If one exists, delete it to prevent any conflicts.

## Open command prompt as administrator

- Open the Windows start menu.
- Type "cmd".
- Select "Run as administrator" to ensure you have the necessary permissions for the upcoming steps.

## Create a directory junction

Use `mklink` to create a Directory Junction that points your Guild Wars 2 Steam folder to the standalone folder. The `mklink` syntax is as follows:

```text
mklink /J <link> <target>
```

- Replace `<link>` with the path to your Steam Guild Wars 2 folder.
- Replace `<target>` with the location of your existing Guild Wars 2 installation folder.

For example:

```text
mklink /J "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Guild Wars 2" "C:\Your\Existing\Guild Wars 2\Folder"
```

## Launch Guild Wars 2 via Steam

Upon completion of the installation process, Steam will recognize the game as installed and immediately display it as playable in your library.

## Using your ArenaNet account on Steam

To utilize your ArenaNet account instead of your Steam account, follow these steps:

### Access Guild Wars 2 properties in Steam library

- Right-click on Guild Wars 2 within your Steam Library.
- Select "Properties."

![Steam properties window]({{ page.asset_path }}/steam_properties_window.png)

### Add launch parameter

- In the Properties window, locate the "Launch Options" section.
- Add the following launch parameter within the Launch Options section:

```text
-provider Portal
```

This parameter ensures that Guild Wars 2 will utilize your ArenaNet account for authentication instead of your Steam account.

## Using Gw2Launcher to launch through Steam

The popular open-source account managing tool, Gw2Launcher, supports launching accounts through Steam.

### General settings

- Click on the menu icon located in the top-left corner of Gw2Launcher.
- Select "Settings."

#### Adjust Steam installation location

If your Steam installation is not in the default directory, specify its location here.

#### Configure launch behavior

Choose how Gw2Launcher should behave when launching multiple accounts through Steam.

### Account settings

- Right-click on the account(s) you intend to launch via Steam within Gw2Launcher.
- Select "Edit."

In the account editing window, navigate to the "Launch options" section.

#### Set provider to ArenaNet

Ensure that "ArenaNet (Default)" is selected under the Provider dropdown menu.

#### Enable Steam launch

Check the box labeled "Launch through Steam" to enable launching via Steam for the selected account(s).

### Limitations

If Steam updates Guild Wars 2 without Gw2Launcher's awareness, launching the game may encounter issues. To resolve this, force-update the game by right-clicking on the affected account and selecting "update."

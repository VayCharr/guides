# Using Directory Junctions

Using a Directory Junction, you can re-use the files you already have from your standalone GW2 installation on Steam. This works because the Steam version is a 1:1 copy of the standalone version (aside from some Steam-specific configuration files).

[mklink â€” Microsoft Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/mklink)]

## Select Installation Location

Determine where you want your Guild Wars 2 Steam installation to be located. The folder structure typically looks like this:

```text
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common
```

Make sure there is no existing Guild Wars 2 folder within your Steam directory. If one exists, delete it to prevent any conflicts.

## Open Command Prompt as Administrator

1. Open the Windows Start menu.
2. Type "cmd".
3. Select "Run as administrator" to ensure you have the necessary permissions for the upcoming steps.

## Create a Directory Junction

Use `mklink` to create a Directory Junction that points your Guild Wars 2 Steam folder to the standalone folder. The `mklink` syntax is as follows:

```text
mklink /J <link> <target>
```

- Replace `<link>` with the path to your Steam Guild Wars 2 folder.
- Replace `<target>` with the location of your existing Guild Wars 2 installation folder.

For example:

```text
mklink /J "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Guild Wars 2" "C:\Your\Existing\Guild Wars 2\Folder"
```

This parameter ensures that Guild Wars 2 will utilize your ArenaNet account for authentication instead of your Steam account.
